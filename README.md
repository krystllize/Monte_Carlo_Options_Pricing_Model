Research Project: Pricing European-style options using Geometric Fractional Brownian Motion and a Monte Carlo Approach.

This research project is one that I have been working on for the past two months as my interest in quantitative finance has grown. My paper detailing my research and code development process can be found in the PDF in this folder, and code will be updated on a regular basis as my research progresses. Please feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions or comments - thanks!
